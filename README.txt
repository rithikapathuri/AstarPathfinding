Pathfinding with A* Algorithm and Visualization

This code demonstrates the implementation of the A* algorithm for pathfinding with dynamic environmental influences such as obstacles and sitters. The environment is represented by a 101 by 101 grid, and the algorithm takes into account both static and dynamic obstacles. The visualization includes gradient and Gaussian maps as well as the pathfinding progress over time.
